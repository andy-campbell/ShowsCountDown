ShowsCountDown
==============

ShowsCountDown is a simple information retriever. It goes out and gets when tv shows are to be aired and displays
the information in a fantastic looking grid.


This is my first go at using C#. It probably has a few things that could be done much more effiecently. If you
find an issue with the code then let me know. I am very happy to rework this code.
